=head1 NAME

MooX::Role::HasLogger - Moo role that provides a logger attribute

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Foo;

  use Moo;
  use MooX::TypeTiny;
  use namespace::clean;

  with qw( MooX::Role::HasLogger );

  sub bar {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Moo::Role> based role provides a C<logger> attribute to the consuming
class.  The attribute is read-only and its value is grabbed lazily. The type
library L<MooX::Role::HasLogger::Types> exports the C<Logger> type constraint
that defines the interface of the attribute. The C<build_logger()> builder
method returns a L<Log::Any> logger object with the consuming class as its
category.
