MooX::Role::HasLogger::Types - Type library that exports the Logger type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This type library exports the C<Logger> type. This type inherits from the

L<Types::Standard> type library. The parameter is the list of methods that a
class has to implement to conform to the C<Logger> type. The list contains the
log methods C<trace()>, C<debug()>, C<info()>, C<warn()>, C<error()>, C<fatal>,
and the corresponding C<is_> prefixed log level detection methods.
