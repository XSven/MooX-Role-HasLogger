NAME

MooX::Role::HasLogger - Moo role that provides a logger attribute

DESCRIPTION

This "Moo::Role based" role provides a "logger" attribute to the consuming
class.  The attribute is read-only and its value is grabbed lazily. The type
library "MooX::Role::HasLogger::Types" exports the "Logger" type that defines
the interface of the attribute. The "build_logger()" builder method returns a
"Log::Any" logger object with the consuming class as its category.
